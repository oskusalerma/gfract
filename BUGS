- Actual bugs

  - Zoom box drawing is pretty primitive. It leaves behind garbage
    if you use it while the image is rendering, and it also doesn't
    handle exposes in any way so it leaves behind a copy of itself
    if you change desktops or something. These are all just visual
    bugs, which don't affect anything, and you can cure them by
    switching off the zoom mode and changing desktops, therefore
    forcing a complete redraw.
