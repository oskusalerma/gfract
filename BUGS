- Actual bugs

  - Zoom box drawing is pretty primitive. It leaves behind garbage
    if you use it while the image is rendering, and it also doesn't
    handle exposes in any way so it leaves behind a copy of itself
    if you change desktops or something. These are all just visual
    bugs, which don't affect anything, and you can cure them by
    switching off the zoom mode and changing desktops, therefore
    forcing a complete redraw.

- Other annoyances

  - You have to watch out for memory use yourself. If you don't have
    enough memory for the image size you requested the program will
    exit with an error message.

  - Window Maker (version 0.50.2 at least) has very stupid and very
    arbitrary limitations of 5 pixels in minimum window width or
    height. This causes the preview window to not handle expose events
    correctly if it's smaller than that in either direction. Doesn't
    do any real harm, though.
