Most of the program is pretty self-explanatory. However, the zoom box
functionality might not be obvious to everyone. The first mouse button 
expands the box, the second button shrinks it, and the third triggers
the zoom (or both buttons together for those of us with only two mouse 
buttons).

The coloring algorithm parser uses RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) format.
