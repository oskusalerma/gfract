RIGHT NOW:

-coloring algos

 -gui

  -checking for validity

 -saving/loading these

-when loading new palette, if coloring algo uses PALETTE_COUNT, and new
palette has different count to last, automatically recalculate image

-optionally store iter/re/im for each calculated pixel, so you can tweak
coloring without recalculating image (needs 12 bytes per pixel -> huge
amounts of memory needed)

-use long double? (~30% slower)

-apply nappi attr dialogiin

POSSIBLY IN THE FUTURE:

-Distributed rendering

 -Multiple threads

 -Multiple machines
