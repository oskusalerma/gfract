You need the following libraries:
 -GTK 1.2
 -libpng 1.0.3. 1.0.3 has a crucial bug-fix so earlier versions
  don't work.
 -libpng requires zlib. 1.1.2 works for me.

First, if you haven't already done so, go get the accompanying
gfract-palettes-??.tar.gz file from the same place you got this
program from. Create the directory /usr/local/share/gfract/palettes
and unpack the archive into it. Make sure the files are
world-readable. (The palettes are from fractint's web site. I assume
they don't mind me redistributing them.)

Then:

-make
-strip gfract (optional)
-cp gfract /usr/local/bin (or where-ever)
-cp gfract.xpm /where/you/keep/your/pixmaps (optional)

Optional: If you use Window Maker, you might want to configure it to
use the supplied gfract.xpm as an app icon.
