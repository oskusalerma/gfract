You need the following libraries:

 -GTK2
 -libpng
 -libz

If you haven't already done so, go get the accompanying
gfract-palettes-??.tar.gz file from the same place you got this program
from. Create the directory /usr/local/share/gfract/palettes and unpack the
archive into it. Make sure the files are world-readable. (The palettes are
from fractint's web site. I assume they don't mind me redistributing
them.)

Then:

-make
-strip gfract (optional)
-cp gfract /usr/local/bin (or where-ever)
-cp gfract.xpm /where/you/keep/your/pixmaps (optional)

Optional: The supplied gfract.xpm works an icon for the program.
